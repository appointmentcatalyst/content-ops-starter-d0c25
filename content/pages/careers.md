      About Us


      At our core, we are a cutting-edge, remote-first call center committed to
      driving growth for contractors across the United States. Our mission is
      simple yet powerful: to deliver appointment-ready, high-intent homeowner
      leads that convert.


      Leveraging a fully automated and data-driven telemarketing system, we
      combine predictive dialing, real-time storm tracking, and advanced CRM
      automation to generate exclusive, high-quality leads. Our workflow is
      designed for efficiency and results—from sourcing verified homeowner data,
      to engaging prospects through Vicidial’s predictive dialer, to capturing
      lead information via embedded JotForms.


      All lead data flows seamlessly into our ecosystem through real-time
      syncing tools like Zoho, Zapier, Calendly, and Google Sheets, ensuring our
      contractor clients receive timely, accurate, and conversion-ready
      opportunities.


      With a lean operational model and powerful automation, we project monthly
      revenues to exceed $50,000 within the first year, reaching profitability
      by Month 3.


      We are not just a call center—we are a strategic growth partner for
      contractors looking to scale their businesses with qualified leads and
      measurable results.
